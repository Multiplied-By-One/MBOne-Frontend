# Multiplied by one frontend
The repo contains the fronted webapp component of Multiplied by One. An app to assist those with Dissociative Identity Disorder.

## Getting started 🚀
👋 Hi, It is great to have you onboard. This section will outline the tech we use and how to get started with it.

### Setting up the repo
To get started you will need to fork the repo run this to install all the required dependencies for the project
```bash
npm i
```

Once that has been run you can run this to start the local development server:
```bash
npm start
```
A server should start on port 3000 (under http://localhost:3000/).
Once that is done you should be good to start developing 🧪

If you would like to run the mock server, you navigate to json-server directory, and run the command:
```bash
npm run json-server
```

### Tech 💻:
The frontend app is a single page application built with:
 * [React](https://create-react-app.dev/)
 * [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
 * [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
